# Module-5-IOD
This Repository was made for Module 5 of my Software engineering course from the Institute of Data.
To open my work you will need to open the folder containing the "index.js" and "package.json" in the terminal,
then you will need to type "npm start" to start the live server from the local port 3000 which can then be accessed via the internet.
